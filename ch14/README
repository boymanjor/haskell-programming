Chapter 14: Testing

"We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask a new question."
                                                - Grace Murray Hopper

-- Notes --

While well-specified types can enable programmers to avoid many obvious and
tedious tests, there is still value to be obtained in executable specifications.
Hspec and QuickCheck are two reputable testing libraries that exist in the
Haskell ecosystem. These deal with spec testing. There is also a Hunit library
that handles unit testing.

The book proposes two branches of testing: unit and property. Unit testing (and spec)
assert the correctness of individual functions. Property testing deals with the
formal properties of program. You define a truth-valued, universally quantified
function and test it against randomly generated inputs. The QuickCheck library
facilitates the generation of the random input. It helps a programmer ensure that
code has met the min. requirements to satisfy laws, e.g. the laws of monads, or
basic associativity.
