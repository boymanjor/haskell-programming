Chapter 7: More functional patterns

"I would like to be able to always...divide the things up into as many pieces as
I can, each of which I understand separately. I would like to understand the way
of adding things up, independently of what it is I'm adding up. - Gerald Sussman

-- Notes --

Haskell functions are first-class entities that make use of syntatic patterns
and can be:
- values in expressions, lists, or tuples
- passed as arguments to a function
- returned from a function as a result

In Haskell, a function is simply an expression with parameters that can return a result.
This allows it to be applied to arguments. These arguments are expressions, themselves,
so it follows that a function could be applied to another function. In programming,
a value that can be used as an argument to a function is a "first-class" value.

We cannot make use of the result of a function until the function is applied to an argument.
This "binds" the parameter of the function to the argument and allows the function to be
evaluated/reduced to a result.

`let` expression can also be used to declare and bind variables.

Pattern matching is used to define function behavior based on different potential arguments.
It can also be used to deconstruct complex datatypes and exppose nested data. Pattern matching
can also be used to operate on tuples (instead of defining functions). This is done by deconstructing
the tuples values into separate variables instead of naming the tuple as one value, e.g.
`
addEmUp :: Num a => (a, a) -> a
addEmUp (x, y) = x + y
`
instead of:

`
addEmUp :: Num a => (a, a) -> a
addEmUp tuple = (fst tuple) + (snd tuple)
`

-- Terminalogy & Concepts --

Anonymous Function: A function created with no name assigned to it. Anonymous
functions are most often used when you're passing a function in as an argument
to a higher-order function and the passed function will only be used once. A
simnple example from another language is a JS callback.

Bottom - A non-value that is returned when a program cannot return a proper
value or result. This can happen when a pattern matched function does not handle
all possible inputs. Using the `-Wall` flag will make the compiler complain about
a function which has cases that will result in a bottom.

Case Expression - Case expressions are similar to if-then-else expressions accept they can
be matched against any datatype with visible data constructors as well.
They follow the form:
`
case CONDITION of
  DATA_CONSTRUCTOR_A -> EXPRESSION_A
  DATA_CONSTRUCTOR_B -> EXPRESSION_B
  DATA_CONSTRUCTOR_N -> EXPRESSION_N
`

Higher-order Function - A function that accepts one or more function as arguments.

Lexical Scoping - Lexical scoping means that resolving the value for a named
entity depends on the location in the code and the lexical context.

`newType` - An alternative data declaration that only permits one constructor and
one field.

Pattern Matching - A mechanism used to define function behvaior based on
matching arguments against specific patterns. Patterns can include: undefined
variables, value constants, and list syntax. Pattern matching matches on any
and all data constructors. Patterns are NOT matched against types. `_` is a
universal pattern (catch-all) that never fails to match. Order matters, so
options should be ordered from most to least specific.

Shadowing - When a variable, which is in scope, is redefined in a nested expression.
The lexically, innermost binding of a variable always takes precedence.
