Chapter 7: More functional patterns

"I would like to be able to always...divide the things up into as many pieces as
I can, each of which I understand separately. I would like to understand the way
of adding things up, independently of what it is I'm adding up. - Gerald Sussman

-- Notes --

Haskell functions are first-class entities that make use of syntatic patterns
and can be:
- values in expressions, lists, or tuples
- passed as arguments to a function
- returned from a function as a result
