Motivated by my friend Dan, I have decided to learn Haskell! My weapon of choice
is Haskell Programming from first principles [1]. This repository holds my notes
and exercises from the book.

Chapter 1: All You Need is Lambda
Chapter 2: Hello, Haskell!
Chapter 3: Strings
Chapter 4: Basic datatypes
Chapter 5: Types
Chapter 6: Typeclasses
Chapter 7: More functional patterns
