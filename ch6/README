Chapter 6: Typeclasses

"A blank cheque kill creativity." Mokokoma Mokhonoana

-- Summary --

The definition of a type declares how that particular type is created.
The declaration of a typeclass defines how a set types are used in computations.
Typeclasses are similar to interfaces from OOP. They allow us to generalize
over a set of types in order to define and execute a standard feature set for
those types.

"The goal is to define a datatype by cases, where one can add new cases to the
datatype, without recompiling existing code, and while retaining static type
safety (e.g. no casts)" - Philip Wadler

Eq, Ord, Enum, Bounded, Read & Show are common typeclasses that are often used in
Haskell and can be derived, i.e. they can be referenced without specific
implementations using the `deriving` in a data declaration.

The syntax for implementing a typeclass is straight-forward:
`
data Trivial =
  Trivial'

instance Eq Trivial where
  Trivial' == Trivial' = True
`

The above implements the Eq typeclass on a trivial datatype by implementing
the (==) function. Note there is only one value that can exist within a Trivial
typed variable. If we expand trivial as follows:
`
data Trivial =
  Trivial' | Trivial''
`

The implementation of the Eq instance needs to cover wore input possibilities:
instance Eq Trivial where
  Trivial'  == Trivial'  = True
  Trivial'' == Trivial'' = True
          _ == _         = False
`

Typeclass constraints allow for polymorphic functions. These specify that an
argument to a function must implement an instance of the specified typeclass.
In this manner, we generalize the behavior of the function. Types in Haskell
can be made more specific, but not more general. This is why the compiler
tries to be as general as possible, and only assigns concrete types at the
last point necessary. When using typeclass constraints on functions, it is
best to apply the minimally sufficient set of constraints that is necessary.

-- Random Notes --

Typeclasses should have rules and lawes about how
they work. They should not just be created on a whim and are an undertaking.

A concrete type always implies the typeclasses that are provided for it.

It can be worth it to avoid concrete types and use typeclass constraints/type
variables whenever possible.

-- Terminology & Concepts --

`()` - Unit; the value returned from an IO action. A Haskell function must
return a result, but a side-effect doesn't necessarily return a value. In this
case the unit is returned. It represents nothing.

IO - The type for values whose evaluation may produce side effects.

IO action - A formula for producing a side-effect. An action can return nothing.
Such an action would have the type `IO ()`. It can also return a concrete type,
such as a `String`, e.g. `IO String`. The latter can be thought of as a "means
of producing a `String`", rather than simply a value of type `String`.

Partial Function - A partial function is one that does not handle all the
possible input scenarios. This would mean that there are possible scenarios
which have no corresponding behavior defined. The `Read` typeclass is a partial
function and should not be used. The compiler can detect partial functions when
the -Wall flag is set.

Read - A typeclass that provides methods for reading Strings and creating
structured data. It is a partial function, which does not handle all types
of data conversions. The typeclass is unsafe and it is recommended not to
use it in practice.

Show - A typeclass that provides methods for creating human readable string
representations of structured data. GHCi uses `Show` to create `String` values
it can print in the terminal. Various number types come with an instance of
`Show`.

Side effect - An observable action a program may take other than evaluating
an expression. If a function modifies some state or interacts with the world
outside of its scope, then it has an "effect" on the world. Haskell introduces
a mechanism for allowing side effects without adding functionality to the pure
lambda calculus it is based on.

Typeclass Inheritance - Typeclass constraints can be placed on a typeclass, e.g.
`class (Real a, Enum a) => Integral a ...` means that any instance of `Integral`
must already have instances of `Real` and `Enum`. The former can be thought of a as
a "subclass" of the latter classes. This inheritance is only additive. A child cannot
override the methods of its parents. This mitigates the typical ambiguity problems
that creep into multiple inheritance implementations of other programming languages.

Typeclass Instance - A unique pairing of a typeclass and a type. It defines the ways
to implement the typeclass methods for that type.
