Chapter 8: Recursion

"Imagine a portion of the territory of England has been perfectly levelled, and
a cartographer traces a map of England. There is no particular of the territory
of England, small as it can be, that has not been recorded in the map. Everything
has its own correspondence. The map, then, must contain a map of the map, that must
contain a map of the map of the map, and so on to infinity."
- Jorge Luis Borges, citing Josiah Royce

-- Notes --

Recursion is defining a function in terms of itself via self referential expressions.
Said another way, recursion is a means of expressing code that must take an indefinte
number of steps to return a result. Each step is initiated by a self referential call
of the function. This process ends when predefined conditions are met
"a base case."

The Y combinator, or fixed-point combinator, is used to write recursive functions in
the lambda calculus. Put simply, the Y combinator is a higher-order function which
accepts a non-recursive function as input and returns a recursive version of the func.
A more in depth discussion is here: http://mvanier.livejournal.com/2897.html

Recursion can be thought of as self referential function composition. Instead of a
fixed number of func applications, recursive functions rely on inputs to determine
when to stop applying functions to successive results.

-- Terminology & Concepts --

Bottom - A term used in Haskell to refer to computations that do not succesfully result
in a value. This can be due to an infinite loop or error.

go function - A Haskell idiom; we define a function within a `where` clause that accepts
more arguments than the top-level function. This is in lieu of being able to declare
variables within an expression.

Maybe - A datatype used to handle functions which may return a result or nothing.

`type` - A keyword used to define type aliases.
